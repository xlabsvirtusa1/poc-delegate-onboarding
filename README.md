# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.


### DB setup
```
node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
```
To setup DB, run the above command.
DB config file is : '/server/config.json'

### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
